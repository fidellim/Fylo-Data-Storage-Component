## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to practice the use of BEM convention.

```css
.container--normal {
	width: 100%;
	max-width: 600px;
	min-width: 500px;
	align-self: flex-end;
}
.container__text--center {
	text-align: left;
}
.progBarTextContainer {
	margin-bottom: 0rem;
}
```

### Continued development

To be able to be more familiar with BEM convention
